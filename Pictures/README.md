# Screenshots from experiments
ESNExperiments contains some results obtained from testin the Echo State Networks with multiple functions, some pictures of the Normalized Root Mean Square Error obtained by both the normal ESN and the ESN driven by a Conceptor, and the effect of the aperture parameter for the Conceptors on said error.

LPZsimulations contains some screenshots from the actual simulator. The log files were lost in a different hard drive for these experiments but the code to run the experiments is provided in the SimulationExperiments folder in the root directory of the project.
