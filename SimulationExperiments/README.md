# Experiments performed in a simulated environment
Some experiments were performed with a spherical robot, a hexapod, and a two wheel drive robot. Only the final experiment is provided, where I use an ESN to drive the spherical robot to different motion setups learned through homeokinesis. 

The esn folder contains the original code provided with the simulator.
