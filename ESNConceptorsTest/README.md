# Matlab code for testing
This code can be ran with Matlab 2009 and above.

The Mackey Glass Generator is shared under the author's license and was used to generate samples for testing the ESN.
The code used to test the behaviour of the ESN with conceptors is in MatlabCode.
Also contains some data used for experiments (mainly samples from the Mackey Glass Equation to simulate chaotic behaviour and some sine functions to determine if the network was actually learning something useful).
